# Welcome

Hi everyone,

This is the beginning of the Land, Sea and Air DCS Multiplayer Mission.

We are still in "early access" but looking forward to your feedback.

Have a read through the documentation, hop on the server and let us know what you think in our Discord.

If you find any issues or unclear information, log a ticket in GitHub and we'll fix it as soon as possible.

Enjoy.

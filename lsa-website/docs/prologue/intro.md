# Welcome to Land, Sea and Air

Land, Sea and Air is a multiplayer, persistent campaign where two sides attempt to capture all objectives to achieve victory.

In order to succeed you must coordinate with your teammates to defend and secure the objectives you control, while simultaneously attacking and capturing the opposition objectives.

We aim to provide a semi-realistic and challenging mission within the possibilities of DCS.

Everyone is welcome to join and play, but please understand that this mission will not attempt to teach basic flying mechanics, or provide "assistance" that would not be available in a real world situation.

# Features

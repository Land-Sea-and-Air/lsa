# Roadmap
- Rolling window play time
- Enforce no taxiway takeoffs
- Use IADS with SAMs (deployed)
- Bases with lighter defenses designed for low level, high-drag bombing (cold war style)
- Add beacons with morse code to the FARPs (and non-airfield bases)
- CSAR (done)
- Move bulls by a command
- Make units move if smoke is nearby
- Request FAC for illumination bombs at a target location (spawn an aircraft to go drop it)
- Allow player to ask for an altitude and speed to the tanker (this will need to be between a certain threshold speed: 300 - 315; alt: 21 - 25)
- Announce tanker/bomber on mission start in SRS
- Announce FAC targets in SRS
- Create a drone FAC (allow F10 marks and BDA of bases)
- Add recon airplane dispatching (much like bombers), should provide same features as drone
  - UK Tornado (special recce variant with internal cameras)
  - German Tornado (Recce pod)
  - Tomcat (TARPS pod)
  - Viggen (special recce variant with internal cameras)
  - MiG-25 (special recce variant with internal cameras)
- Create "Compile mission" option
